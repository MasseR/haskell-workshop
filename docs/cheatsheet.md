# Cheatsheet â€” Haskell Workshop 1

## Syntax

- Import the `mapMaybe` function from the `Data.Maybe` module:

  ```haskell
  import Data.Maybe (mapMaybe)
  ```

- Declare a new module called `Main`, implementation goes
  after the `where` keyword:

  ```haskell
  module Main where
  ```

- Pattern-matching with `case`:

  ```haskell
  case expr of          -- test eval of expr
    pattern1 -> expr1   -- if pattern1 matches, eval expr1
    pattern2 -> expr2   -- elseif pattern2 matches, eval expr2
    _        -> exprn   -- else, eval exprn
  ```

## Types

- `::` is used to denote the type of a term, for example `3` is a value of type
  `Int` and also a value of type `Double`:

  ```haskell
  3 :: Int
  3 :: Double
  ```

- `id` is a function (its type is `->`) taking any value of type `a` and
  returning a value of type `a`. How many functions of this type are there?

  ```haskell
  id :: a -> a
  ```

- `Bool` is a sum type:

  ```haskell
  data Bool = False | True
  ```

- `Maybe` is a sum type, with a type parameter `a`, as is `[]` (List):

  ```haskell
  data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a
  data [] a = [] | [] : [a]
  ```

- `String` is exactly a list of `Char`:

  ```haskell
  type String = [Char]
  ```

## Useful Functions

- 
  ```haskell
  putStrLn :: String -> IO ()
  B.putStr :: B.ByteString -> IO ()
  ```

- Encode a value to JSON:
  ```haskell
  JSON.encode :: ToJSON a => a -> B.ByteString
  ```

- Keep only the first element of a list:
  ```haskell
  head :: [a] -> a
  ```

- Remove the first element of a list:
  ```haskell
  tail :: [a] -> [a]
  ```

- Reverse the order of a list:
  ```haskell
  reverse :: [a] -> [a]
  ```

- Split a string on `\n`, split a `String` on `Char`:
  ```haskell
  lines   ::         String -> [String]
  splitOn :: Char -> String -> [String]
  ```

- Read a `String` into a Haskell value:
  ```haskell
  readMaybe :: Read a => String -> Maybe a
  ```

- Apply a function to all elements of a list, returning a new list.
  ```haskell
  map      :: (a ->       b) -> [a] -> [b]
  mapMaybe :: (a -> Maybe b) -> [a] -> [b]
  ```

- Read/Write a full file into/from a `String`:
  ```haskell
  readFile :: FilePath -> IO String
  writeFile :: FilePath -> String -> IO ()
  ```

- Reverse the order of a list:
  ```haskell
  show :: Show a => a -> String
  ```

## REPL tricks

- Show the type of an expression:
  ```haskell
  :t Just True
  ```

- Reload the currently loaded module:
  ```haskell
  :r
  ```
