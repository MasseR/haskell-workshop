# A Haskell Workshop

Let's write a practical Haskell application from A to Z! The first application
we'll write together will be simple, yet concrete. Its sole purpose, in the most
traditional UNIX philosophy, will be to turn CSV into JSON.

## Who Is It For?

This is intended for people with a programming background who are curious about
trying out Haskell for real world tasks. No previous knowledge of Haskell
will be needed and by the end of the workshop, you will go home with a fully
functional (pun intended) program.


## Workshops

- [Workshop 1](workshop1) introduces stack and a simple haskell application

## Going further

We'll be there to guide and answer all (most) of your questions. We also have
plans to grow this workshop series to include more challenging and more
interesting areas, like:

- Practical track:
  - Making it faster: running your functions in parallel, ... Just ask Samuli
    Thomasson, he wrote a f@!# book about it;
  - Make it safer: going through type safety, enriching your types, ...
- Theoretical track:
  - Classical abstractions (Monoid, Functor, Applicative, Monad, ...)
  - Parametric Polymorphism, Ad-Hoc Polymorphism, ...
