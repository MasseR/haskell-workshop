# Outline of workshop 1

During this 2 hours workshop, we will go through these different steps:

1.  Setting up your working environment:
    - Installing stack
    - Building a simple hello world
    - Running the resulting program
    - Starting a REPL, and calling functions in there
    - And more!

1.  Presenting the Hello World:
    - Syntax!
    - What's IO?
    - Read and write to the command line (putStrLn, getLine)
    - Importing external libraries

1.  Writing up your domain model:
    - Presenting Product type and records
    - Light intro to typeclasses (Show, ToJSON, TypeClasses)

1.  Writing your first pure function, taking a String and returning a Model:
    - What are (haskell) functions
    - Composition
    - Pattern matching

1.  Writing your second pure function, taking a Model and returning a Value:
    - Revising what we've just seen

1.  Putting it all together:
    - Compose our pure functions
    - Reading/Writing to a file (hPutStrLn,hGetLine)
    - Plugging everything together
